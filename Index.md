Week 8 Hardware
-------------------
This blog entry is to give an update into my progress on my hardware sensor. At this point in the semester (Week 8), I am on schedule. However, I connected the SSD1306 OLED sensor using I2C connection but it did not work. I tried various times using various appropriate pin connectors but it still didn't work. The professor suggested tried connecting using SPI instead of I2C; or in case that didn't work, tried using an Arduino to see if that works. During the course of this week I will contact Vlad or Kelly at the prototype lab to figure out this problem. So this is a minor, or possibly a major setback in my progress. It will also put me in a negative finalcial status since I will have to repurchase the OLED sensor in the worst case scenario.
