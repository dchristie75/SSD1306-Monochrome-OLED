Week 8 Hardware
-------------------
This blog entry is to give an update to my progress on my hardware sensor. I connected the SSD1306 OLED senssor using I2C connection but it did not work. I tried various times using various appropriate pin connectors but it still didn't work. The professor suggested tried connecting using SPI instead of I2C; or in case that didn't work, throed using an Arduino to see if that works. During the course of this week I will contact Vlad or Kelly at the prototype lab to ficure out this problem.
