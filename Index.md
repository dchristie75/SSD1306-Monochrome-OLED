===============


Week 9 PCB
---------------
This blog entry is to give a progress update on my hardware project. Last week there were some issues detecting the sensor's I2C address. However, after visiting Kelly and Vlad in the prototype lab during the course of the week we managed to find the problem and correct it. So at this time I am on track and within budget of my project. The PCB schema was designed and sent to the prototype lab for etching. I do not need to purchase any further part for the project so no additional cost is added to my original budget. Moving on to the soldering porting of the project next week.


Week 8 Hardware
-------------------
This blog entry is to give an update into my progress on my hardware sensor. At this point in the semester (Week 8), I am on schedule. However, I connected the SSD1306 OLED sensor using I2C connection but it did not work. I tried various times using various appropriate pin connectors but it still didn't work. The professor suggested tried connecting using SPI instead of I2C; or in case that didn't work, tried using an Arduino to see if that works. During the course of this week I will contact Vlad or Kelly at the prototype lab to figure out this problem. So this is a minor, or possibly a major setback in my progress. It will also put me in a negative financial status since I will have to repurchase the OLED sensor in the worst case scenario.
