### Introduction
The aim of this hardware project is to integrate a sensor/effector with the Broadcom development platform also known as the Raspberry Pi in oerder to read/write data to the device. The sensor/effecor I have chosen for this project is the SSD1306 OLED Monochrome Display from Adafruit. It is a 1" diagonal display that is made of 128X64 individual white OLED pixels that uses both SPI and I2C interfaces. Over the course of fifteen weeks I have created the project proposal, a project breakdown schedule, a budget for the project, and acquired the hardware devices, anong with the components to put them together. I have also breadboarded a circuit to test my sensor with the development platform with Fritzing. Using that design, I created a custom PCB for laser etching, then soldered the acquired components to the PCB for final assembly. 


This stackable interface board for the Broadcom development platform also known as the Raspberry Pi is of a hand solderable design meant to be compatible with the devices in the Humber Parts Crib which require more skills and techniques to assemble. It has a bidirectional LED and three I2C device sockets. The bidirectional LED allows the hardware equivalent of "Hello World" to be achieved by blinking the LED. I2C is a very common hardware peripheral bus and is designed to have an analog breakout board, a Real Time Clock module, and an integrated environmental sensor module connected. It takes most individuals about a week of effort to complete these build instructions directed towards technologically inclined students especially given other commitments. Be aware that the image creation steps take at least 3 hours alone.
