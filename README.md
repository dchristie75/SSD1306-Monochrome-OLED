### Introduction
The aim of this hardware project is to integrate a sensor/effector with the Broadcom development platform, also known as the Raspberry Pi, in order to read/write data to the device. The sensor/effecor I have chosen for this project is the SSD1306 OLED Monochrome Display from Adafruit. It is a 1" diagonal display that is made of 128X64 individual white OLED pixels that uses both SPI and I2C interfaces. Over the course of fifteen weeks I have created the project proposal, a project breakdown schedule, a budget for the project, and acquired the hardware devices, anong with the components to put them together. I have also breadboarded a circuit to test my sensor with the development platform with Fritzing. Using that design, I created a custom PCB for laser etching, then soldered the acquired components to the PCB for final assembly. The image above is the final stackable interface for the project.
